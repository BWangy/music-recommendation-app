# NewMusic

An app to help you find new music to listen to. The site may take a while to load on startup as the backend is currently deployed on the free tier on Render, which spins down web services that go 15 minutes without inbound traffic. My app is also still in Spotify development mode so I have to manually add users that want to access my app. I made a video below to demonstrate the app's functionality.
